================

I am learning about atom, because I want to create an all encompassing programming IDE and tutorial series with it.

Currently, my first goal is to improve the syntax highlighting of the TypeScript language to be more legible, and useful. I will be forking the [atom-typescript](https://atom.io/packages/atom-typescript) package, and hacking that.

Atom looks to have a very nice introductive narrative called [Atom Flight Manual](https://atom.io/docs/latest/).

I enjoy:

Found the `terminal-plus` package, and I was able to have it run my portable git-bash using `..\PortableGit\bin\sh.exe` with arguments `--login -i`
